### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
Explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
In this project, we write Python code to import US bike share data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. We also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time):
- most common month
- most common day of week
- most common hour of day

Popular stations and trip:
- most common start station
- most common end station
- most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

Trip duration:
- total travel time
- average travel time

User info:
- counts of each user type
- counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
- earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
